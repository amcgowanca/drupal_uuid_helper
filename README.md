## UUID Helper

A helper module that assists in working with and enhancing the use of Universal Unique Identifiers in Drupal 8.

### Features

* Displays UUID information on core enabled entities. (e.g. node)
* Allows for entity paths to be accessed by specifying the entity UUID instead of that of the serial identifier (e.g. `node/[uuid]` instead of `node/[nid]`)
* Rewrites all outbound entity paths to be represented with the UUID instead of serial identifier (e.g. `node/[uuid]` instead of `node/[nid]`).
